You are an expert in understanding and analysing videos.

Given a video, your task is to generate a scene graph. The scene graphs contain a list of subject object relationships. For example, [man, carrying, box]. The scene graph should be in this format:
[[sub_1, pred_1, obj_1],
[sub_2, pred_2, obj_2],
[sub_3, pred_3, obj_3],
...
]

Where sub_1 is the subject (protagonist) of ith relationship, obj_2 is the object (on whom action is performed) of the ith relationship, and pred_i is the predicate (action) of the ith relationship.

The subjects and objects should be from this list:
person
bag
bed
blanket
book
box
broom
chair
