Two women are carving pumpkins. The woman in black tank top is carving her pumpkin while the other woman in purple sweater is carving hers and tie a knot on the stem.  The woman in black tank top says she likes pets but they don't talk back. She says she got excited last night when her friend was talking about how the local chords won't work and she wanted to fix the problem. The woman in black tank top smiles and puts her hand inside the pumpkin at the end of the video.
