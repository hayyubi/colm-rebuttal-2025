In a large warehouse, two people wearing bright yellow safety vests with name tags are standing on the other side of a large, brown paper roll that is being rotated on a turntable. A man wearing a plaid shirt and a yellow safety vest is standing behind the paper roll, holding a rope to stop it from rotating.
