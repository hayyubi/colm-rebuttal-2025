A white sheep is standing in a pen, looking down at a black lamb. At the same time, a second white sheep is standing behind the first white sheep. The white sheep bends down and sniffs the black lamb, then moves its head up and licks the black lamb. The white sheep then continues to sniff and lick the black lamb.  The black lamb does not appear to be hurt by the white sheep's actions.
