A little girl in a pink shirt and red and white striped pants is playing with a paper airplane in her house. She throws the paper airplane to the right and then runs after it. After the paper airplane lands on the ground, she runs back to the area where she started. After she gets back to the starting position, she throws the paper airplane again. At the same time, a white dog is sleeping on the couch.
