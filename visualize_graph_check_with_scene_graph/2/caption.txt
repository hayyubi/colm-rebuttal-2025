A young girl with long blonde hair is playing with the straps of a baby car seat. The baby inside the car seat is laying down. The girl pulls on the strap and makes a noise, and the baby kicks its feet. While the girl pulls on the straps, the baby is looking at her and kicking its feet. The baby is in the seat, and the girl is on her knees in front of the seat.  The girl pulls the strap and says "Going, going, later" repeatedly.  The baby continues to kick its feet while the girl is pulling on the strap.
