A toddler in a red toy car drives in a circle on a paved path in a park while a young boy in a white shirt and blue shorts pushes the car. The toddler asks for help while the boy pushes the car. At the same time, the boy is laughing, probably because the toddler is stuck in a circle. Finally, the boy bends down beside the car and turns back.
