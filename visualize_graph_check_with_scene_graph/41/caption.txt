A baby in a black T-shirt with a rainbow and a white star printed on it and purple pants is playing with a silver ipod.  At the same time, there are books on the shelf behind the baby. Then, the baby starts to make sounds "Hello", "Du-du", "Du", "Du", "Du", "Du" into the ipod, which makes the baby more enthusiastic, causing the baby to start putting down the ipod and trying to crawl forward. Meanwhile, a lady is trying to help the baby to open the ipod but baby is resisting. After the lady helped the baby to open the ipod, the baby starts to play with the ipod and make sounds again.  After playing with the ipod for a little while, the baby started to crawl and play with a stainless steel pot.

After finding a new toy, the baby starts to play with the new toy. Then the baby gets excited about the new toy and the video ends.
