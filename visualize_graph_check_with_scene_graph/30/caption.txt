A yellow excavator with a jackhammer attachment is breaking apart a concrete bridge. It is working alongside an orange excavator to remove the bridge.  The yellow excavator is using its jackhammer to break the bridge apart, causing the bridge to break into smaller pieces. After the bridge breaks into smaller pieces, the yellow excavator can reach the rocks in the bridge.
